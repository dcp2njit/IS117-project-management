    <p>
      I build Minimal Systems portfolios and product artifacts that earn trust
      through clarity, structure, and evidence. My focus is on organizing complex
      work into readable systems: crisp problem framing, explicit constraints,
      and documented decisions. I prioritize grid discipline, stable component
      rules, and a controlled visual language so the content does the convincing.
      I also keep a tight feedback loop with stakeholders to ensure the outcomes
      are measurable and the work is reproducible.
