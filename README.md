## Reflection

The process of making this website was somewhat confusing for me. Despite how this process is meant to streamline development and how straightforward the directions are, I still wasn't sure if I was doing exactly what was asked of me. I did not add any real content for now but I focused mainly on the website as a structural system. I learned that even with certain specifications AI can still make mistakes and overlook things that were explicitly asked of it. That might have been mostly human error though, as I still feel I am not efficient and concise with the prompts I use. This assignment helped me see however the importance of structure. I do feel the visuals of the website could have been improved a lot more. I chose a minimal style direction and it really was minimal, and all the iterations and fixes I made were minute and did little to the overall appearance. Aside from that, I tried reviewing the outputs more critically and saw that they definitely needed to be actively verified to enforce specifications. The phases of this assignment helped me understand how planning impacts the AI's ability to maintain a project. Again, I feel like I may have forgotten to do some steps in the process, but I was still able to see the importance in disciplined structure and careful validation of each step/sprint.
